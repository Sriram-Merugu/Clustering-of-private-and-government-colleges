# Clustering-of-private-and-government-colleges

This project focuses on predicting whether a given college is private or not using K-Means clustering. 
The goal is to cluster colleges based on certain features and determine the private/public classification for each cluster.
The dataset used for this project contains information about various colleges, including attributes such as tuition fees, student-faculty ratio,
graduation rate, acceptance rate, and more. The dataset includes a target variable indicating whether the college is private or public.

# Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) installed.
Download the college dataset (provide the source and instructions for obtaining it) and place it in the same directory as the code file.
Execute the code and observe the clustering and classification results.
Customize the code as needed to experiment with different features, clustering parameters, or evaluation methods.
